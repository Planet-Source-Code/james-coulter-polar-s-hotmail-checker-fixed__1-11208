## Polar's Hotmail Checker \*\*FIXED\*\*


</div>

### Description

Checks Hotmail account for new messages. This is almost exactly the same code as Polar's original checker, but it has been fixed so it works better. If you want to do more with this code, you'll need a packet sniffer. Use it to capture the HTTP headers that are transfered when you do things on the hotmail site. You'll also have to be pretty good with a parser.

If for some reason this code still does not work properly, please contact me.
